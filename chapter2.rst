chapter 2: Data Structure
=============================================


2.1 numbers
----------------------------


.. code-block:: python


    my_int = 20    # int
    my_float = 45.5  # float
    my_complex = 20j   # complex
    #Print the values of the above declared varibales
    print(my_int)
    print(my_float)
    print(my_complex)
    #Print the Data Types of the above declared variables
    print(type(my_int))
    print(type(my_float))
    print(type(my_complex))



2.2 Int
----------------------------


.. code-block:: python


    normal_int   = 10
    large_int    = 46333666787711
    negative_int = -25452233

    print(type(normal_int))
    print(type(large_int))
    print(type(negativee_int))


2.3 Float
----------------------------


.. code-block:: python


    #Normal Float varibles
    my_float_1 = 1.10
    my_float_2 = 1.0
    my_float_3 = -35.59

    print(type(my_float_1))
    print(type(my_float_2))
    print(type(my_float_3))

    #Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

    my_float_4 = 35e3
    my_float_5 = 12E4
    my_float_6 = -87.7e100

    print(type(my_float_4))
    print(type(my_float_5))
    print(type(my_float_6))
