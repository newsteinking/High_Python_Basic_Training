chapter 5: List
================================================

5.1 List
----------------------------


.. code-block:: python


    my_list = ["1", 2, "hello"]
    print(my_list)

    #You access the list items by referring to the index number:
    fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(fruit_list[1])

    #To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:

    fruit_list[1] = "blackcurrant"
    print(fruit_list)

    #You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
    for x in fruit_list:
      print(x)

    #To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the in keyword:

    if "apple" in fruit_list:
      print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")

    #To determine how many items a list have, use the len() method:

    print(len(fruit_list))

    #To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:

    fruit_list.append("orange")
    print(fruit_list)

    #To add an item at the specified index, use the insert() method:

    fruit_list.insert(1, "orange")
    print(fruit_list)

    #There are several methods to remove items from a list:
    fruit_list.remove("blackcurrant")
    print(fruit_list)

    fruit_list.pop()
    print(fruit_list)

    # To delet item in list
    del fruit_list[0]
    print(fruit_list)

    #The clear() method empties the list:
    fruit_list.clear()
    print(fruit_list)

    #The del keyword can also delete the list completely:
    fruit_list["23","44","66"]
    del fruit_list
    # print(fruit_list) If we try to execute this it will give error of undefine list

    #It is also possible to use the list() constructor to make a list
    fruit_list = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
    print(fruit_list)

    #Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.
