==================================

5.1 Tuple
----------------------------


.. code-block:: python


    #Create Tuple
    my_tuple = ("2","2.55","Sudhir",2.4,556);
    print(my_tuple)

    #Access item in tuple
    print(my_tuple[1]);

    #Change the tuple value(Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable)
    # my_tuple[1] = "blackcurrant"
    # The values will remain the same:

    # You can't do following operations on tuble
      # 1. append,
      # 2. insert,
      # 3. delete,
      # 4. remove,
      # 5. pop

    #Loop Through a Tuple
    # You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.
    bikes_tuple = ("Triump Tiger","Kawaski Ninza","MV Augusta","Tiger 800 XC")
    for bike in bikes_tuple:
      print(bike)

    #Check if Item Exists(To determine if a specified item is present in a tuple use the in keyword)
    if "Triump Tiger" in bikes_tuple:
      print("Yes, 'Triump Tiger' bike is in the bikes tuple")

    #The tuple() Constructor
    #It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.

    bikes_tuple = tuple(("Triump Tiger","Kawaski Ninza","MV Augusta","Tiger 800 XC"))
    print(bikes_tuple)

    #Methods
    # 1. count(value) -> Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
    temp_tuple = (1, 3, 5, 8, 7, 5, 4, 5, 8, 5)
    count_of_five = temp_tuple.count(5)
    print(count_of_five)

    #2. index() - Search for the first occurrence of the value 8, and return its position:
    index_of_eight = temp_tuple.index(8)
    print(index_of_eight)

    #The index() method raises an exception if the value is not found.
