8.1 Dictionaries
----------------------------


.. code-block:: python


    #Create and print a dictionary:
    my_car_dict = {
      "brand": "Ford",
      "model": "Mustang",
      "year": 1964
    }
    print(my_car_dict)

    #Accessing Items
    #You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
    car_model = my_car_dict["model"]
    print(car_model)


    #There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:
    player_dict = {
      "cap_id": 101,
      "name": "Virat",
      "highest_score": 183
    }
    highest_score = player_dict.get("highest_score")
    print(highest_score)

    #You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:
    player_dict["cap_id"] = 175
    print(player_dict)

    #The dict() Constructor
    dict_with_constructor = dict(brand="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1964)
    # note that keywords are not string literals
    # note the use of equals rather than colon for the assignment
    print(dict_with_constructor)
